    Player.broadcast: 7,
    Player.connect_nbr: 0,
    Player.fork: 42,
    Player.eject: 7,

## Environment Categories

Pre-configured environment types available through `Category` dictionary:

- `"alone"`: Single player environment
- `"group"`: Multi-player same level
- `"random_group"`: Multi-player random levels
- `"survival"`: Limited food challenge
- `"incantation"`: Ready-to-elevate scenario
- `"close_incantation"`: Almost-ready elevation scenario

## Error Handling

### Common Response Codes
- `"ok"`: Command executed successfully
- `"ko"`: Command failed (insufficient resources, invalid action, etc.)
- `"message <dir>, <text>"`: Broadcast message received
- `"eject: <dir>"`: Player was ejected from tile
- `"Elevation underway"`: Incantation started successfully

### Exception Handling
- Invalid commands are ignored with console warning
- Out-of-bounds positions are wrapped using modulo arithmetic
- Resource operations fail gracefully with "ko" response
- Dead players cannot execute commands
